## ❓ What is this?

This is simply a text-based list of over 600 domains that are used by the company Admiral, which is "the visitor relationship management company". They make an anti-adblock piece of software, which is also likely used to help collect analytics on users who visit their website.

In order to do this, they use hundreds of domains to facilitate this. This repository contains as many domains as are known about, with each domain separated by a newline. These are provided for educational and research purposes only.
